# Persisted native queries

`QueryTemplate::new` lowers compact conjunctive authoring forms to the shared
Rust query AST, with canonically ordered result rows. Use
`QueryTemplate::native(query, input_arguments, sources)` to embed the ordinary
Rust `Query` AST with its ordinary result ordering. Both constructors execute
through the same query engine and use one current program format.
The same program has deterministic canonical bytes and identity. Earlier
development formats require fresh databases.

For example, this query program returns entity/value rows above a threshold;
the attribute itself is a program argument, not a fixed schema assumption:

```rust
use atomic_core::*;

fn selector() -> Result<Program, SemanticError> {
    let mut query = Query::new(
        FindSpec::Relation(vec![
            FindElement::Variable("entity".into()),
            FindElement::Variable("value".into()),
        ]),
        vec![
            Clause::Pattern(Box::new(DataPattern::new(
                Term::var("entity"), Term::var("attribute"), Term::var("value"),
            ))),
            Clause::Predicate {
                predicate: Predicate::GreaterOrEqual,
                source: "$".into(),
                args: vec![Term::var("value"), Term::var("minimum")],
            },
        ],
    );
    query.inputs = vec![
        InputSpec::Scalar("attribute".into()),
        InputSpec::Scalar("minimum".into()),
    ];
    Ok(Program {
        kind: ProgramKind::Query,
        arity: 2,
        instructions: vec![
            Instruction::Query(QueryTemplate::native(query, vec![0, 1], vec![])?),
            Instruction::ForEach {
                body: vec![Instruction::Unpack(2), Instruction::EmitRow(2)],
            },
            Instruction::Return,
        ],
    })
}
```

Invoke it with `ProgramRuntime::execute_query` and one captured `&DatabaseValue`,
passing an attribute ref/ident and the threshold. Deploying the same artifact
can use `PostgresOperator::install_program(&client, request_key, ident, &program,
&dependencies, timeout)`. This stages the complete immutable closure and submits
ordinary `:db/ident` / `:db/fn` assertions. Dependencies may be supplied in any
order; an exact retry resolves its durable receipt before inspecting them.

For applications composing their own binding transaction,
`PostgresOperator::deploy_program(&program)` returns a `ProgramHash`. Fixed
dependencies must already be present. Staged code is protected for the GC grace
period; no application-owned deployment handle or release call is necessary.
Committed database roots retain bound code. Collection removes expired unbound
staging roots and their otherwise-unreferenced code. Missing dependencies fail
rather than publishing broken code. Transaction-kind programs can consume
the query result using ordinary VM instructions and emit transaction forms;
they still run against the transaction's immutable db-before. Staging alone does
not install a function binding; `install_program` performs both steps.

Native templates support the shared evaluator's predicates, functions, recursive
rules, `not`/`not-join`, `or`/`or-join`, dynamic attributes, aggregates and Pull.
Input mappings are positional program-argument indexes; tuple, collection and
relation inputs use runtime vectors. All named database sources derive from the
invocation's exact value, including its existing filters:

- Empty sources mean `QueryTemplateSource::current("$")`.
- `QueryTemplateSource::history("$history")` exposes assertions and retractions.
- `.as_of(QueryTemplateTime::Argument(2))` and `.since(...)` accept a nonnegative
  Long T, a transaction Ref, or an Instant argument. `Literal(TimePoint::...)`
  embeds an explicit bound. Bounds compose with the captured value's view.
- `QueryTemplateSource::log("$log")` supplies its actual captured committed log
  to `Function::TxIds` / `TxData`. Database time filters do not truncate that
  log; use explicit log-function ranges. Eager fixtures, speculative values and
  opaque predicate filters cannot supply a committed log and return Unsupported.
  Database history is never substituted for a log, including with `noHistory`.

The evaluator shares the enclosing program's fuel, deadline, cancellation,
row/collection and retained-value allocation limits. Failed query work is not
refunded when a caller reuses a `ProgramBudget`. Durable ASTs also have bounded
depth, node counts and the existing 4 MiB program payload limit. These are
cooperative limits, not hard allocator or PostgreSQL preemption guarantees.

This is native serializable code, not closure/JVM serialization: callback
extensions, custom aggregate callbacks, callback Pull transforms and random/sample
aggregates are rejected. Compiled transaction callbacks are a separate explicit
[native deployment](../07_peer_api/02_native_computation.md), not program serialization.
Ordinary query containers use VM vectors/maps where those preserve their shape.
`RuntimeValue::Query` carries general data losslessly, including arbitrary map
keys, sets, characters and inert tags. The existing scalar-only result variant
remains `ProgramOutput::Query`; non-stored cells use `GeneralQuery`. These query
carriers are not additional stored transaction-value types. Use
`execute_query_general` for general arguments and `QueryTemplateSource::relation`
for named raw relation arguments. See [general query data](../05_query_and_pull/01_application_data.md).

[The lifecycle fixture](../../tests/program_native_queries.rs) combines recursive selection and native execution, exercises speculative and
committed execution, retained prior bindings, exact retries before/after restart,
and verifies canonical program round trips. Run its actual PostgreSQL
checks with `ATOMIC_POSTGRES_URL` set; it creates a disposable isolated schema.

# Ordered indexes and the transaction log

Most application reads should use Datalog or Pull. Raw index cursors are useful
when order, range traversal or integration needs an explicit datom stream.
Indexes contain datoms, not just pointers requiring an entity fetch for each row.

| Order | Leading access | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EAVT | Entity, attribute | All applicable facts |
| AEVT | Attribute, entity | All applicable facts |
| AVET | Attribute, value | Indexed and unique attributes whose projection is ready |
| VAET | Referenced entity, attribute | Reference-valued facts |

Current and history views use their respective covering trees plus the captured
recent information. History exposes assertions and retractions; current views
collapse them according to the supplied time window and filters. Indexing can
advance later without changing an already captured value.

## Cursor and range boundaries

`DatabaseValue::scan_cursor(order)` opens a lazy full ordered scan.
`prefix_cursor(&IndexPrefix)` restricts the selected prefix; `seek_cursor` and
`reverse_seek_cursor` begin at an `IndexBoundary` and continue beyond its supplied
components. A seek position is not an implicit prefix restriction.
`datoms` and `datoms_with_prefix` are explicitly materialized conveniences.

Build boundaries with schema-aware helpers such as `avet_boundary` and
`aevt_boundary`. Idents, references and lookup refs resolve against the same
immutable value. Partial tuple values are virtual seek positions, not legal
partial stored tuples; see [tuple boundaries](../02_core_concepts/00_database_values.md#partial-tuple-boundaries).
Validate AVET readiness with `has_avet`; schema intent and completed physical
backfill are different observations.

Consume fallible cursors and handle errors. Construction does not imply the
future traversal is I/O-free, and an error ends that cursor. Cache misses can
load an entire admitted node; cache accounting is neither RSS nor a total read
budget. Measure consumption, not just construction. The executable
[index authoring tests](../../tests/read_index_authoring.rs) demonstrate forward,
reverse and temporal boundaries.

## Ordered Pull

`IndexPullOptions::new(start, selector)` traverses one AVET or AEVT attribute
range and projects each selected datom lazily. AVET pulls the entity component;
AEVT reference traversal pulls the referenced entity. It stops when the attribute
changes, not merely when the supplied second component changes. Repeated
references may yield repeated projections; there is no hidden entity deduplication.

Options select direction, offset and an optional result limit; the native default
is unlimited. Limit zero validates without visiting datoms. Use
`index_pull_with_control` for cooperative cancellation across traversal and Pull.
Raw history is not a point-in-time entity projection. See [Pull](../05_query_and_pull/02_pull_and_entities.md)
and the [index-Pull examples](../../tests/index_pull.rs).

## The log is not an indexed history view

`Connection::log()` or `Peer::log()` captures an immutable endpoint.
`LogValue::tx_range(start, end)` uses an inclusive start and exclusive end;
omitted bounds select the captured range. T, transaction references and instants
have explicit `TimePoint` representations. A later commit does not extend this
cursor. `tx_data` selects an exact transaction.

Log transactions retain additions and retractions even when `noHistory`
consolidation omitted facts from indexes. Excision can change retained generation;
the log is not an exception to that policy or a storage retention pin. Traversal
authenticates pages and keeps one decoded transaction plus navigation state;
caller-retained events and large legal transactions still cost memory.

Use [query log sources](../05_query_and_pull/00_queries.md#transaction-logs-and-provenance)
to join provenance, [change consumers](../07_peer_api/03_change_consumers.md) for
acknowledged replay, and the optional [local log cache](../09_optional/02_log_cache.md)
for shared cache configuration and counter meanings.

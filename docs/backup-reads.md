# Query a backup directly

`BackupConnection::open(path)` opens the latest published point without a
transactor, PostgreSQL connection, restore or full replay. `open_point(path,
&point)` selects an exact `BackupPoint` from `PortableBackup::list_backup_points`.
`db()` and `log()` keep that fixed point even when later backups are published.
Relative repository paths are anchored when opened; changing the process's
working directory does not redirect an existing handle's later reads.
Retain the point's lineage, generation, basis and manifest hash when sharing it.
An online `SnapshotReference` is not a backup locator.

The values use the existing query, Pull, entity, history/time-view, local `with`,
program-resolution and log APIs. Speculation never changes the backup. The
repository-backed block snapshot uses the same selective index, fulltext and
native-program readers as live peers. It has no live catalog route, writer
authority or database pin, and cannot create an online `SnapshotReference`.

The stock executable accepts the same EDN commands without PostgreSQL credentials:

```sh
atomic query --repository /private/backups/customers --file query.edn
atomic pull --repository /private/backups/customers --file pattern.edn --entity 12345
atomic with --repository /private/backups/customers --file transaction.edn
```

Use `--backup-basis N --backup-generation N` together to select a listed point.
`--database` and `--repository` are mutually exclusive. File `-` reads stdin;
results remain EDN. Named query sources also accept
`{:repository "/private/backups/customers" :basis 42 :generation 0 :log true}`;
omit `:log` for a database source, or both coordinates for the latest point.

## Cost and integrity

The current manifest retains the canonical publication and a separate exact
covering read value. Both use the live engine's object formats. Capture folds
any recent tail and completes pending AVET projections through the shared index
preparer, writing new objects only into the repository. The canonical
publication and exact receipts are unchanged. Fulltext attachments use the same
builder; log seeks use authenticated page/skip links rather than a second
backup-specific log index. Preparation adds capture-time work and can retain
the admitted tail; ordinary offline opening does not replay it.

A fresh database can be backed up immediately after `atomic create`, including
an empty basis. Required canonical, receipt-base and program objects must be
available; missing provenance is an error, not permission to drop exact retries.

Opening reads root and schema/ident metadata; data leaves and log payloads are
loaded on demand and authenticated against their immutable references. Missing
or corrupt required files return errors, and failed cursors fuse. A previously
authenticated cached value remains valid. Direct reading is not a substitute
for deep semantic backup verification.

`BackupReadConfig` bounds decoded-node cache entries/bytes, including zero to
disable it. Snapshot roots/schema/idents, active cursors and caller-retained
results are separate memory. `read_stats()` reports immutable-object bytes/read
counts, including object admission; repository directory/claim/locator metadata
and OS block traffic are not included. Complete-path wall time includes them.
`cache_stats()` reports retained cache bytes, hits and evictions.

Repository file sizes and envelope lengths are checked before body allocation
against current format limits, independently of the cache budget. Current
objects have a 64 MiB physical and decoded size ceiling. A single admitted read
cannot follow a growing file beyond its accepted length; authentication and
format decoding then validate the canonical bytes. Valid objects remain
readable with a smaller or disabled node cache.

`tests/backup_reads.rs` measures capture and open/query/consume/drop separately
at 64 and 8192 entities. It also removes the source schema before exercising
offline fulltext, native programs, history, speculation and log reads. Current
block-format measurements are recorded after running that fixture; older
relational-backup timings do not describe this implementation. Selective access
does not imply constant memory or latency; normal leaf size limits still apply.

These development backups are not a cross-version compatibility promise. Create
a current-version backup from a supported database; unsupported versions fail
explicitly. No tool silently resets a database. Current-version durability,
restart, exact retries and backup/restore remain required. Backup repositories
are private operator-owned directories. Excision does not erase independent
older backups or copies; retention and deletion remain explicit operations.
